# Juma Uplift

Juma, jigsaw puzzles for representing mapping, is a method that applies the block metaphor to mapping languages. 

This aplication allows users to create mappings that transform non-RDF data to RDF that are serialized in [R2RML](https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/) and [SML](http://sml.aksw.org/).

Find more information about this implementation of the method and the Juma Uplift application in [1] and in http://openscience.adaptcentre.ie/juma/ .

## Using the code
This code was developed using Java 8, maven and a MySQL database.

To execute the application go into project folder using terminal, and run the command mvn jetty:run. The default port is 8080.

Database connections can be modified in src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml

In order to run mappings you need to install the following [R2RML engine](https://opengogs.adaptcentre.ie/crottija/r2rml) into your maven repository.
